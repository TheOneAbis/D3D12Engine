# D3D12 Engine
Here you will find the source code for my D3D12 engine built for a class.
Some of the basic setup was written by my professor:
- Transform.h/cpp
- Camera.h/cpp
- Input.h/cpp
- Window.h/cpp
- LightingFunctions.hlsli
- VToP.hlsli

Check out the Raytracing branch for the raytracing version of this engine.
